{: style="text-align: justify;"} 
I am an experienced Data Scientist currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s at Carnegie Mellon University focusing on Artificial Intelligence applications. With 1.7 years as an Energy Analyst in a dynamic management consulting environment, and currently interning as a Data Scientist at O-I, I am honing my skills in AI and ML to solve real-world problems. I am actively seeking full-time roles in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence starting May 2025.

Passionate about problem-solving, I believe that good problem solvers excel across all domains. As new technologies and challenges emerge, my goal is to adapt and leverage AI as a powerful tool in my problem-solving repertoire. This drive brought me to CMU, where I am dedicated to expanding my skillset in AI and ML. My aim is to be the go-to person for data-centric problem-solving, utilizing my strong foundation in mathematics and data science.

Skills:
Languages: Python, C, C++, OpenGL, LaTeX, SQL
Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch, SciPy, TensorFlow, CUDA
NLP: Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain
Other: Consistently expanding my skillset and quickly adapting to new tools

In my spare time, I enjoy playing chess, as it continuously challenges my problem-solving abilities. I also aspire to live and work across different countries to truly experience and understand diverse cultures beyond tourism.

Beyond technical skills, I foster an environment of inclusivity and communal learning, believing that the most challenging problems can only be solved through collective expertise. I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and discuss any problem-solving opportunities. If you bring a challenging problem to me, consider it a favor, as it truly excites me.
