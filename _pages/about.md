Pranav Bahl completed his master's degree from the Dept. of Aeronautics, Imperial College London (ICL) in concentration Advanced Computational Methods for Aeronautics, Fluid mechanics and fluid-structure interaction. At Imperial, he is primarily exploring autonomous data-driven chaotic dynamical systems utilizing classical and quantum recurrent neural networks. His courseworks at Imperial ranged from Turbulence/Turbulence modeling, Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to Machine learning/Artificial intelligence & Computational linear algebra. Previously, he completed his bachelor’s at the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Delhi Technological University (DTU) formerly Delhi College of Engineering. During his bachelor's degree he was primarily interested in exploring Deep learning based Reduced order models (ROMs) for large scale, physics-based high-fidelity simulations either for autonmous evolution of discretized PDEs or for the state-estimation problems. Pranav’s interests lies in the intersection of Scientific computing, Deep learning and Optimization algorithms, where he aims to enhance interpretability of these black-box models with applications pertaining to complex high-order physical phenomena, since deep learning architectures alone cannot be relied upon to be used as a black-box with little or no information of the principles behind the physics of the problems being solved.
