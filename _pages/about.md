Pranav Bahl is a Master's student at the Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London (ICL) studying Advanced Computational Methods for Fluid Mechanics. Previously, he completed his Bachelor’s at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Delhi Technological University (DTU) formerly Delhi College of Engineering. 

Pranav’s interests lie in the intersection of computational fluid dynamics, machine learning and high-performance computing where he aims to significantly reduce the cost of high-fidelity physics-based simulations eventually leading to faster design, optimization and control.
