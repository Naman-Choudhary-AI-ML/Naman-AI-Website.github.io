***Dynamical systems*** are encountered within nature through various conformal representations ranging from physical phenomena such as turbulence to bacteria population dynamics to financial investment dynamics to the movement of extraterrestrial planets, etc. The common denominator in all these mutually exclusive examples is the *dependence on time (either discrete or continuous)* and the evolution of their respective degrees of freedom (DOFs) with time. However, the underlying governing equations that dictate this evolution arenâ€™t always readily accessible or are computationally expensive endeavours. This necessitates the exploration of autonomous data-driven algorithms. There have been significant strides in the development of classical computing hardware and, in recent years, quantum computing hardware, which further accelerates the development of these algorithms. This is where the core of my research lies!

### (Ongoing Research Project) Quantum gated recurrent neural networks  

We numerically investigated a model system in which a passively deployable, torsionally hinged flap is mounted on the suction surface of a stationary airfoil via high-fidelity nonlinear simulations as shown in the figure below.

### Classical gated recurrent neural networks - An autonomous dynamical system

We are currently designing an active flow control counterpart of the above-mentioned passive flow control strategy for further augmenting the airfoil lift.
