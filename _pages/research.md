# Research
Pranav's Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has become an indispensable tool for many engineering applications. Unfortunately, high-fidelity CFD simulations are often so computationally prohibitive that they cannot be used as often as needed or used only in special circumstances rather than routinely. Model order reduction (MOR) is a family of techniques for reducing the computational complexity of such large-scale computational models. This is where the core of my research lies!

## 1. Deep learning and Chaotic dynamical systems
Pranav control is a process of manipulating the flow to achieve desirable aerodynamic performance.

### (Ongoing Research Project) Quantum gated recurrent neural networks  

We numerically investigated a model system in which a passively deployable, torsionally hinged flap is mounted on the suction surface of a stationary airfoil via high-fidelity nonlinear simulations as shown in the figure below.

### Classical gated recurrent neural networks - An autonomous dynamical system

We are currently designing an active flow control counterpart of the above-mentioned passive flow control strategy for further augmenting the airfoil lift.

### Deep learning based effecient data-driven reduced-order model (ROMs) for temporal evolution
Recently, deep convolutional autoencoders have been used to construct nonlinear manifolds for model order reduction.

## 3. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
Traditional ROM approaches cannot be expected to efficiently provide good approximations.
